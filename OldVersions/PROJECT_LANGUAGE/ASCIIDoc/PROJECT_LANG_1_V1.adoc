= Project language file 1

== For: seanpm2001/Learn-ASCIIDoc

=== About:

I decided to make ASCIIDoc the main project language file for this project (Seanpm2001/Learn-ASCIIDoc) as ASCIIDoc is the language this project is dedicated to, because this project is about learning the ASCIIDoc programming language. It only makes sense to ASCIIDoc the official language for this project. It is getting its own project language file, starting here.
